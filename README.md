# CARSpace: Revolutionizing Parking Management

CARSpace is an innovative solution aimed at revolutionizing parking management by effectively quantifying total cars and available parking spaces within a parking lot. This is achieved through the application of advanced image processing techniques, resulting in a cost-effective sensor solution.

## Features

- **Quantification of Parking Spaces**: Utilizing Python and libraries such as OpenCV and CVzone, CARSpace accurately quantifies the total number of cars present in a parking lot and determines the availability of parking spaces in real-time.

- **Cost-Effective Solution**: By leveraging basic image processing techniques, CARSpace significantly reduces the overall cost of implementing parking sensors compared to traditional methods.

- **User Interface**: To enhance usability and streamline the development process, CARSpace incorporates a user-friendly interface created using advanced libraries including CVzone and PyQt5. This allows for easy interaction and seamless integration with existing parking management systems.
